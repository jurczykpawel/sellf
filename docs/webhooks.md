# Webhooks

Sellf delivers events to customer-configured HTTPS endpoints with HMAC-signed payloads, automatic retry, a per-tenant dead-letter queue, and an admin Replay UI. The model deliberately mirrors what Stripe, Paddle, and Lemonsqueezy do.

## Event payload

Every delivery carries this envelope:

```json
{
  "event": "purchase.completed",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-23T12:34:56.789Z",
  "data": { /* event-specific */ }
}
```

### Headers

| Header | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `X-Sellf-Event` | Event name, e.g. `purchase.completed` |
| `X-Sellf-Signature` | `HMAC-SHA256(secret, raw_body)` as lowercase hex |
| `X-Sellf-Timestamp` | ISO-8601 timestamp the payload was signed at |
| `X-Sellf-Retry-Attempt` | Present on attempts 2 through max; integer (`"2"`, `"3"`, …) |
| `X-Sellf-Retry` | `"true"` on legacy admin Resend (the old `/retry` endpoint) |

### Signing verification (Node example)

```js
import crypto from 'crypto';

function verify(rawBody, headerSignature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(headerSignature));
}
```

## Retry policy and DLQ

When a delivery fails (network error, non-2xx response, SSRF block) the worker retries with exponential backoff before declaring the delivery permanently failed:

| Attempt | Delay before next retry |
|--------:|------------------------:|
| 1 → 2   |                    1 min |
| 2 → 3   |                    5 min |
| 3 → 4   |                   30 min |
| 4 → 5   |                    2 hrs |
| 5 → 6   |                   12 hrs |

After the 5th failed attempt the delivery enters the **dead-letter queue** (status `permanently_failed`). It stays there until an admin clicks **Replay** in `/dashboard/webhooks/deliveries`, at which point the attempt counter resets to 0 and the row goes back to `pending_retry` with `next_retry_at = NOW()` for the worker to pick up.

### Concurrency safety

`pick_due_webhook_deliveries(limit)` uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` plus a 60-second `next_retry_at` lease, so:

- two concurrent cron invocations never dispatch the same delivery
- a worker that crashes mid-dispatch automatically releases its rows after 60 s

### State machine

```
[INSERT after first dispatch]
  → success                                  (dispatch ok)
  → pending_retry                            (fail, retries remain)
  → permanently_failed                       (fail, no retries — only when max_attempts=1)

pending_retry --(worker, ok)-->         success
pending_retry --(worker, fail, <max)--> pending_retry [attempt_count++, exp backoff]
pending_retry --(worker, fail, >=max)--> permanently_failed [failed_permanently_at=now]
permanently_failed --(admin Replay)-->  pending_retry [attempt_count=0, next_retry_at=now]
pending_retry --(admin Cancel)-->       permanently_failed
pending_retry --(admin Force now)-->    pending_retry [next_retry_at=now]
* --(admin Archive)-->                  archived
```

## Admin actions per status

| Status               | Actions                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `success`            | Resend                                  |
| `pending_retry`      | Retry now, Cancel                       |
| `permanently_failed` | Replay, Archive                         |
| `failed` (legacy)    | Retry, Archive                          |
| `retried` / `archived` | view only                            |

`failed` and `retried` are pre-DLQ legacy statuses. New deliveries never land in `failed` — a failed first attempt now produces `pending_retry` with the retry already scheduled.

## REST API

All endpoints under `/api/v1/webhooks/logs/[id]/*` require the `webhooks:write` scope.

| Method & Path | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| `POST /retry` | Legacy. Creates a new log row and marks the original `retried`. Use only for old `failed` rows. |
| `POST /replay` | DLQ Replay. Only valid for `permanently_failed`; resets `attempt_count` to 0 and re-queues for immediate retry. |
| `POST /force-retry` | Pulls a `pending_retry` row forward to `next_retry_at = NOW()`. |
| `POST /cancel` | Flips a `pending_retry` row to `permanently_failed`. |
| `POST /archive` | Soft-archives any row. |

Listing logs supports filters `status=pending_retry|permanently_failed|all_failed` in addition to the existing `success|failed|archived|retried|all` values. `all_failed` is the union `failed + pending_retry + permanently_failed`.

## Operator setup

The worker is exposed at `/api/cron?job=webhook-deliveries-retry`. Schedule it to fire every minute from any cron source you trust (PM2, system cron, an external scheduler) with the shared `CRON_SECRET` bearer token:

```cron
* * * * * curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" "$SELLF_URL/api/cron?job=webhook-deliveries-retry" > /dev/null
```

### Queue driver selection

The queue lives behind a small interface so the storage backend can swap without touching `WebhookService` or the UI:

```
WEBHOOK_QUEUE_DRIVER=supabase   # default
WEBHOOK_QUEUE_DRIVER=sqs         # AWS SQS stub (throws NotImplemented)
```

A future SQS implementation would replace `pickDue` with `ReceiveMessage`, `markFailed` with `ChangeMessageVisibility`, and `markPermanentlyFailed` with `SendMessage` to a configured DLQ queue. `webhook_logs` would remain the audit log of attempts in either case.

### Known limitations (operator-facing)

These are intentional MVP shortcuts in the 2026-05-24 batch-ops cut. None are correctness bugs, but operators recovering from a large outage should know about them. Tracked in `BACKLOG.md → Outgoing Webhooks v2.0` for the next sprint.

- **List capped at 50 rows.** `/dashboard/webhooks/deliveries` fetches `limit=50` with no pagination. Select-all toggles those 50, not the full DLQ. For backlogs above 50, switch the filter, replay the visible page, refresh, repeat — or use SQL to bulk-update `status='pending_retry'` directly.
- **Batch loop is client-side `Promise.allSettled`.** N parallel POSTs from the browser, no jitter. A network drop mid-batch leaves a partial outcome (run again on the survivors). Safe up to ~100 items; above that consider SQL bulk-update.
- **No rate-limit jitter against the receiver.** If the destination has a strict per-minute limit, a 100-item batch can briefly trip 429s on its side. Those become `pending_retry` and pick up on the next cron tick — but the toast will report partial failure.
- **Retry policy is global.** `RETRY_DELAYS_SECONDS = [60, 300, 1800, 7200, 43200]` and `max_attempts = 5` apply to every endpoint. No per-endpoint override yet (e.g. 1-attempt Slack alerts vs 10-attempt paid CRM).
- **Replay / Cancel are irreversible.** No undo. A fat-finger Cancel on 50 rows requires `UPDATE seller_main.webhook_logs SET status='pending_retry', failed_permanently_at=NULL WHERE id IN (...)` to restore — practically impossible without keeping the log id list.
